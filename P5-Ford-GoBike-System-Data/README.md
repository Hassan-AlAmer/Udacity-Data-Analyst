# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Hasan Al-Amer

## Project Overview
    This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
        In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
        In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Dataset
    This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area:  
        - duration_sec           
        - start_time             
        - end_time               
        - start_station_id       
        - start_station_name     
        - start_station_latitude   
        - start_station_longitude  
        - end_station_id         
        - end_station_name       
        - end_station_latitude   
        - end_station_longitude  
        - bike_id                
        - user_type              
        - member_birth_year      
        - member_gender          
        - bike_share_for_all_trip  
   
**The initial dataset includes 183412 rows and has 16 columns. After finish cleaning data 174952 rows and 8 columns**


## Summary of Findings
     - The most common user type is Subscriber with 90.5%.  
     - The average of the trip duration is 11.73 minutes.  
     - Male is the most bike user gender.  
     - we notice that averagely customers spend time twice as much subscribers on daily basis; however, they tend to spend more time on weekends (Saturday & Sunday).  
     - we notice that Customers rides much longer durations than subscribers no matter what the gender they are.  



## Key Insights for Presentation
     -Top 10 user start station names
     -The trips duration minutes
     -Relationship between start day and gender
     -Trip Duration by day and User Type
     -Trip Duration by User Type and Gender
